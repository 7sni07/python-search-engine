FIFA finally settles the debate and says Arab Cup is not an official title,IntroductionAware175,2025-11-13 16:55:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1ow4q64/fifa_finally_settles_the_debate_and_says_arab_cup/,"""While team honours have so far eluded him in a league that is increasingly rich in star talent and investment, he has not let his own standards falter.

The Spanish site of FIFA says this as well:

""Aunque aún no logró conseguir un título oficial"" which in English means ""Although he has not yet managed to win an official title""

I'm only making a post because a previous upvoted post was misleading and tried to say that said FIFA acknowledged it as official. [https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18w54dm/fifa\_acknowledged\_that\_arab\_club\_champions\_cup\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/18w54dm/fifa_acknowledged_that_arab_club_champions_cup_is/)

In a blog post on [FIFA.com](http://FIFA.com), it spoke of the amount of goals scored that year, and it counted goals from the Arab Cup, so people surmised that it was being counted as an official trophy. However, it never directly said they were official goals or excluding friendlies. Now we know the definitive answer from FIFA about the status of that competition."
Looking Into Claims About Ultra Groups and Criminal Links,OkTranslator1326,2025-11-13 00:38:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1ovlejj/looking_into_claims_about_ultra_groups_and/,"I’ve been reading about how some ultra groups in Europe might be getting influenced by political or criminal networks, and I found an investigation that pulls together court documents, media reports, and public records. It doesn’t paint all fan groups the same, but it shows how certain factions can end up involved in intimidation, pressure tactics, and off-pitch interests. Curious how accurate this is for people who follow ultras more closely.

[CabineSport] Benfica's sporting director Mario Branco threatened the referee after draw against Casa Pia,ZaiduTheGOAT,2025-11-11 16:36:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1oucjwv/cabinesport_benficas_sporting_director_mario/,"🚨 Referee Gustavo Correia denounces threats and harassment from Benfica's director:

""I report that Mr. Mário Jorge dos Santos Branco, general director of the A team (SL Benfica), at the end of the game, entered the field of play, addressing me and uttering the following words: 'Honor the insignia you wear on your chest, you're a fucking disgrace! I'm going to smash you and João Bento, who was the VAR!' For this reason, I showed him a direct red card.

I also report that he pursued the refereeing team during the walk from the pitch to the locker room corridor, uttering the following words to me: 'You can be sure I'm going to smash you to pieces, you're telling me! I'm going to blow you and João Bento up! You're worthless, neither you nor him! Fucking clowns, it's a disgrace, what you did to us here today was a disgrace.'""

Rashfords currently on 13 G/A in all competitions I personally predicted 25 when I saw he'd signed.. Would it be fair to say because of his perception in the media in the UK this will always be downplayed?,AdExtension917,2025-11-11 07:35:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1ou2e2w/rashfords_currently_on_13_ga_in_all_competitions/,"For example Jude I believe had around the same amount of G/A in his first season at christmas, but I suppose the difference with Jude was he's a media darling and nobody a little bit like Scott mctominay expected him to  do as well as quickly.. 
Where as with Rashford most knew
Deep down he'd probably do well but theissue
Is you didn't do well in your last 3 seasons at united.. 

I do find it interesting when people say it's a farmers league that's why he's doing so well like he didn't score 80+ in premier League "
Real Madrid's UCL Mentality: Why Psychology Still Outweighs Tactics,vishesh_07_028,2025-11-09 19:58:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1osrhut/real_madrids_ucl_mentality_why_psychology_still/,"Real Madrid's success in the Champions League is less about a fixed tactical system and more about a unique, deep-rooted psychological advantage that defies football logic.

1. The Paradox of Space :

• La Liga: RM often struggles against low blocks, which deny space to their attackers.

• Champions League: Major European opponents are motivated to attack, creating the space behind their defence that Madrid's pace (Vinícius, Rodrygo) and long-passing (Kroos, Modrić) thrive on. Big European teams effectively hand Madrid the perfect counter-attacking conditions.

2. The Cult of the Comeback :

The club's most defining trait is the remontada (comeback), which reinforces internal belief and instills fear in opponents.

• Examples: The 2022 run against PSG and Manchester City saw RM trailing on aggregate in the final minutes before staging impossible, sudden turnarounds.

• Impact: This ensures that opponents know the game is never truly over, giving Madrid an enormous psychological edge over 90 minutes.

🗣️ Question for Insightful Dialogue
Is Real Madrid's consistent Champions League success primarily due to superior talent and tactics, or is their unique, inherited psychological confidence and heritage the most critical, separating factor in high-stakes knockout games?"
RELEASE CLAUSSES WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSFERS,mirracc93,2025-11-07 20:11:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1or3bqm/release_clausses_when_it_comes_to_transfers/,"I have one question, if anyone knows. If one club makes offer for a player and the other club accepts the offer(most of the time first club triggers release clause), is the player allowed to rufese transfer, or he has no choice once clubs make the deal? I never understood this, because: A) If player can not refuse tranfer after transfer clause is being activated/his club accepts the offer, what is stopping rich clubs to buy main players from their rivals? Could Man UNited jsut buy Gerrard with enough money, would Gerrard be forced to move? Could Liverpool do it for Giggs? Chelsea for Henry? Perez in second galacticos era for Messi/Iniesta? Would Gerrard really be forced to go to Man United if Liverpool would just told him ""hey, we got 150M offer for you(crazy money in his era), we can not resist that money,therefore we are selling you""? Woudl gerrard jsut have to play for man united? Barca could spend 100M on one player 10 years ago, what if they offered that money for Ramos and Perez accepts, woudl Ramos jsut have to play for Barcelona? ALso, many juve players that refused to leave club in 2006 and prob had great offers(del piero, nedved, buffon). It doesnt make sense, but...

B) If player has choice to refuse transfer and is also being asked if he wants to go or not, how come that we have so many examples of players that openly stated that they didnt want to go to other club, but club just sold them and there was nothing they could do about it. Im too lazy to think of many examples, on the top of my head are crespo to england, torres to chelsea, di maria to man united, robinho to man city, joao felix to atletico, ronaldo nazario to inter. Im watching footie for 25 years, I rememebr tons of examples where player was like ""I never wanted to go to \*\*\*, but my club sold me""

So what is it, can player refuse transfer after release clause/transfer deal, or he doesnt get to say anything?"
Should football be played at a slower pace?,Best_Cockroach3598,2025-11-05 19:30:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1opaz0g/should_football_be_played_at_a_slower_pace/,"Am a Chelsea fan, and seeing Palmer, Delap, James, Colwill, Fofana and Badiashile struggle with injuries has me wondering whether the practicality of playing an ultra athletic football is helping anything. I know it’s probably worse in other teams around Europe who are giving very young and inexperienced players debuts because the senior team is in treatment tables, so this post isn’t complaining that Chelsea have it worse or best.

I was wondering whether it is helpful to maybe slow down the pace of games. Maybe reduce the intensity at which some matches are played just to protect the players. It may not be the popular opinion, but I personally don’t want to see Cole Palmer turn into another Ansu Fati for us."
